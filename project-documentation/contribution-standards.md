# Contribution standards overview

The sandbox now centralizes its policies in the [contributor guide](../docs/contributor-guide.md). Use this overview as a quick reference when preparing updates.

## Core principles

- Preserve reproducibility by documenting Rhino/Grasshopper versions, plugin dependencies, and validation steps.
- Respect binary assets: confirm licensing, version large files with Git LFS, and avoid unnecessary changes to third-party libraries.
- Append to research histories instead of overwriting past insights.

## Quick checklist

Before opening a pull request, confirm that you:

- [ ] Updated documentation and indices affected by your change.
- [ ] Validated new Grasshopper components, scripts, or data entries.
- [ ] Captured supporting screenshots, renders, or notes when they improve clarity.
- [ ] Ensured third-party libraries are redistributable and tracked appropriately.
