# Alexandria Lab sandbox

Alexandria Lab's sandbox is a safe workspace for iterating on Grasshopper tooling, research datasets, and reference literature before changes graduate to the primary repository. Use this space to prototype components, document experimental workflows, and practice contribution processes without impacting production assets.

## What's inside

| Area | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `alexandria-application-files/` | Plugin binaries, user objects, scripts, and sandbox files that power the Alexandria Grasshopper experience. |
| `artificial-intelligence-dataset/` | Prompt notebooks, structured CSV indices, and working notes that capture AI-assisted design research. |
| `parametric-design-literature/` | Curated PDFs and manuals that inform computational design practices. |
| `docs/` | Centralized documentation, including the user guide and contributor guide. |

## Documentation

Two documentation tracks keep designers and contributors aligned:

- **[User guide](docs/user-guide.md):** Installation steps, system requirements, and sandbox usage tips.
- **[Contributor guide](docs/contributor-guide.md):** Repository standards, workflow expectations, and validation checklists.

Review the contributor guide before opening pull requests so your updates follow the established conventions.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alexandria-lab/alexandria-lab-sandbox.git`
2. Read the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) to install plugin assets and explore the sandbox examples.
3. Follow the [contributor guide](docs/contributor-guide.md) when proposing changes, documenting research, or sharing new assets.

## Support and feedback

Have questions or spot documentation gaps?

- Open an issue describing the scenario, Rhino/Grasshopper versions, and expected outcome.
- Propose improvements directly via pull requestâ€”include screenshots or renders for user-facing updates.
- Reach out on the Alexandria Lab communication channels to coordinate larger documentation or tooling initiatives.

Maintaining clear, user-friendly documentation ensures the sandbox remains a reliable launchpad for experimentation and learning.
