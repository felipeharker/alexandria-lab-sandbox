# Alexandria Lab sandbox

Alexandria Lab's sandbox is a safe workspace for iterating on Grasshopper tooling, research
datasets, and reference literature before changes graduate to the primary repository. Use this
space to prototype components, document experimental workflows, and practice contribution
processes without impacting production assets.

## What's inside

| Area | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| `alexandria-application-files/` | Plugin binaries, user objects, scripts, and sandbox files that power the Alexandria Grasshopper experience. |
| `artificial-intelligence-dataset/` | Prompt notebooks, structured CSV indices, and working notes that capture AI-assisted design research. |
| `parametric-design-literature/` | Curated PDFs and manuals that inform computational design practices. |
| `docs/` | Centralized documentation for onboarding, contribution workflows, validation, and release tracking. |

## Documentation highlights

Choose the guide that matches your current goal:

- **Getting started:** Read the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md) for installation steps, then
  complete the [hello world tour](docs/hello-world-tour.md) to validate your setup.
- **Exploring assets:** Browse the [sandbox index](alexandria-application-files/sandbox-files/README.md)
  and [component reference](docs/component-reference.md) to understand available examples and
  user objects.
- **Contributing:** Follow the [contributor guide](docs/contributor-guide.md), record QA with
  the [validation log template](docs/validation-log-template.md), and announce updates in the
  [release notes](docs/release-notes.md).
- **Managing datasets:** Consult the [AI dataset data dictionary](artificial-intelligence-dataset/data-dictionary.md)
  before editing CSV resources or notebooks.

## Getting started

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alexandria-lab/alexandria-lab-sandbox.git`
2. Install plugin assets using the [user guide](docs/user-guide.md#install-the-alexandria-plugin-bundle).
3. Duplicate a sandbox file and complete the [hello world tour](docs/hello-world-tour.md) to
   confirm your environment.
4. Review the [contributor guide](docs/contributor-guide.md) before proposing changes or
   documenting research.

## Support and feedback

Have questions or spot documentation gaps?

- Open an issue describing the scenario, Rhino/Grasshopper versions, and expected outcome.
- Propose improvements directly via pull requestâ€”include screenshots or renders for user-facing updates.
- Reach out on the Alexandria Lab communication channels to coordinate larger documentation or tooling initiatives.

Maintaining clear, user-friendly documentation ensures the sandbox remains a reliable launchpad
for experimentation and learning.
