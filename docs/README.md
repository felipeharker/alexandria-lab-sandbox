# Alexandria Lab documentation

The sandbox now maintains dedicated guides for the two primary audiences—designers exploring
Grasshopper workflows and contributors extending the toolkit. Start with the entry point that
matches your current task, then branch into the specialized references listed below.

## Role-based entry points

- **Designers and newcomers**
  - [User guide](user-guide.md) – Installation, system requirements, troubleshooting.
  - [Hello world tour](hello-world-tour.md) – Hands-on walkthrough that wires key components
    and captures outputs.
  - [Sandbox index](../alexandria-application-files/sandbox-files/README.md) – Catalog of
    ready-to-duplicate `.gh` examples.
- **Plugin contributors**
  - [Contributor guide](contributor-guide.md) – Repository architecture, workflow
    expectations, coding standards, and review tips.
  - [Validation log template](validation-log-template.md) – Structure for capturing QA steps
    in issues or release notes.
  - [Release notes](release-notes.md) – Running history of notable updates and validation
    highlights.
- **Data and research curators**
  - [AI dataset data dictionary](../artificial-intelligence-dataset/data-dictionary.md) – CSV
    schemas, allowed values, and maintenance checklist.
  - [Component reference](component-reference.md) – Metadata for user objects and scripts that
    feed the datasets and sandbox examples.

## Documentation standards

All Markdown should follow the conventions described in the contributor guide: sentence-case
headings, descriptive link text, wrapped paragraphs, and dated entries for research notes.
Reference or extend this index whenever you add a new guide so collaborators can find it
quickly.
