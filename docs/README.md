# Alexandria Lab documentation

The Alexandria Lab sandbox maintains two complementary documentation tracks:

- **User guide** – Helps designers install the Alexandria Grasshopper plugin, load bundled assets, and explore the sandbox examples.
- **Contributor guide** – Establishes expectations for extending the plugin, curating datasets, and submitting changes.

Use the links below to jump directly to the reference you need:

- [User guide](user-guide.md)
- [Contributor guide](contributor-guide.md)

All documentation follows the conventions listed in the contributor guide. When you add new Markdown content, structure headings with sentence case, wrap paragraphs to a readable width, and include dated context for research notes.
