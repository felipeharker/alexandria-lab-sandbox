2. **Isotropic Distortion Mapper**
   Warps any input grid (square, hex, triangular) with a distortion field based on mathematical functions (e.g. sine/cosine, Perlin noise, attractor points).

4. **Pattern Genome Sampler**
   A component that takes a “genetic string” (e.g., a list of numbers or booleans) and produces deterministic patterns: lines, arcs, and fills mapped to that genome.

12. **Attractor-Driven Extrusion Field**
    Turns 2D patterns into extruded geometries where height, taper, and rotation are mapped to attractor points or curves.

13. **Dynamic Boolean Array**
    Arrayed 3D primitives (spheres, cubes, metaballs) that automatically union/subtract based on proximity rules, generating porous or cellular morphologies.

16. **Pattern Library Browser**
    A Grasshopper component that loads a catalog of pre-defined 2D/3D patterns (hex, Cairo, Penrose, Islamic stars, etc.), instantly parameterized.
