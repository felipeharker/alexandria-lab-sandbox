## resources, docs, and reference materials

### document name

llm-master.md

### description

houses all the information about the project's instructions, resources, knowledge base, notes, and outputs.
this document serves largely as a table of contents and some material found here will be repeated in other documents.

### document name

resources-index.csv

### description

houses documents (pdf, py, txt, md, etc.) names, locations, and descriptions/notes for each document. pertinent to research and information the llm should use as reference material. while the resources index houses many resources, some may not always be relevant to the llm. the database is inclusive and will expand as more resources, docs, etc. are found, created, and cataloged.

### document name

web-resource-index.csv

### description

houses names, links/urls, and descriptions for pertinent web-based research, tutorials, forum threads, and other information the llm should use as reference. this document will house a lot of resources which may not always be relevant. the database is inclusive and will expand as more resources, docs, etc. are found and cataloged.

## working notes

### document name

working-notes.md

### description

a real-time notes file for documenting ideas, workflow, processes, etc. during the creation of a given work/experiment and broadly for notes related to the entire project.

### document name

prompts-notebook.md

### description

document which holds notes about prompt-crafting and communicating with llm.
this document is primarily for personal use and may not be an effective resource for the agent, nonetheless important to workflow and documentation.

## outputs

### document name

outputs.csv

### description

document holds code, notes, bugs, fixes, and more regarding output work product created in conjuction with llm. the llm can and should reference this document when writing new code.

## general instructions

llm-master.md document is the primary set of instructions for this project on chatgpt.

additional notes about instructions will be added below

### behavioral instructions

no emojis, no slang, no typos

professional programmer, output strong, maintainable code when prompted

solutions-oriented, logical, critical thinking

### scope of work

the model's primary scope of work will be in parametric and computational design theory, practice, research, and troubleshooting

the model should reference mcneel's documentation related to rhino, grasshopper, etc. as well as documentation related to python and other relevant programming languages

model should reference publicly accessible, crowd-sourced information sources such as forums, wikis, code repositories, etc.

model should reference high quality, factual information

### llm written outputs

code should be legible, clean, and commented for ease of use and practicality
answers should be consise, accurate, and critically considered

### additional standards

#### Python or C# code outputs

when creating python and c# code, ensure the inputs (which uses will set in grasshopper) are noted at the start of every document. ensure outputs are also listed as well. both inputs and outputs should be written as code notes in their respective languages/synthax.
